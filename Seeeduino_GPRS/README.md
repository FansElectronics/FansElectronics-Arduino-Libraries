Seeeduino GPRS is a IoT panel, you can connect to the internet through GPRS wireless network with it. Making/answering voice calls and sending/receiving SMS messages are also supported. Meanwhile, Seeeduino GPRS supports FM radio function and bluetooth communication. For more information, you can visit our [Wiki](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino_GPRS/).

### Features
+ Compatible with standard Arduino Leonardo
+ Quad-Band 850/900/1800/1900 MHZ
+ Headset Jack
+ Convenient external SIM card holder
+ Control via AT commands
+ Support Bluetooth
+ Support FM


### Applications
+ Call up and answer Call
+ Send SMS and read SMS
+ AT Command Test
+ TCP Connection
+ Bluetooth Communication
+ FM radio

### Getting Started
please follow the example sketch in example folder.
+ SIM800_Serial_Debug —— test SIM800 module with AT commands.
+ GPRS_CallUp ——  give a call to someone.
+ GPRS_SendSMS —— send a message to someone.
+ GPRS_LoopHandle —— answer the call & read the message.
+ GPRS_ConnectTCP —— communicate with xively.
+ FM_Test —— Listening to FM radio
+ Bluetooth_AT_Command_And_Music_Play —— use your bluetooth device to control seeeduino GPRS with AT Command or use your smartphone to connect it and play music.
+ Bluetooth_Call_PhoneNumber —— Use your smartphone to connect seeeduino GPRS and a auto-call action will be executed.  

Note：There is another library has better performance [GPRS SIM900](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/GPRS_SIM900), to use it, exchange the RX and TX pins.  
+ #define PIN_TX    7    ------   #define PIN_TX    8
+ #define PIN_RX    8    ------   #define PIN_RX    7

Sample of using GPRS_SIM900 library - GPRS_TCPConnection.ino
```C
#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
#include <Wire.h>
#include "sim900.h"

#define PIN_TX    8  // Has already exchanged TX and RX pins
#define PIN_RX    7

#define SIM800_POWER_PIN        9  // Define SIM800 power status and control pins
#define SIM800_POWER_STATUS     12

//make sure that the baud rate of SIM800 is 9600!
//you can use the AT Command(AT+IPR=9600) to set it through SerialDebug
#define BAUDRATE  9600

char http_cmd[] = "GET /media/uploads/mbed_official/hello.txt HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n";
char buffer[512];
GPRS gprs(PIN_TX, PIN_RX, BAUDRATE);
void setup(){
  Serial.begin(9600);
  SIM800_PreInit();
  // use DHCP
  while(!gprs.init()) {
      delay(1000);
      Serial.print("init error\r\n");
  }
  delay(3000);    
  // attempt DHCP
  while(!gprs.join(F("cmnet"))) {
      Serial.println("gprs join network error");
      delay(2000);
  }

  // successful DHCP
  Serial.print("IP Address is ");
  Serial.println(gprs.getIPAddress());

  if(!gprs.connect(TCP,"mbed.org", 80)) {
      Serial.println("connect error");
  }else{
      Serial.println("connect mbed.org success");
  }

  Serial.println("waiting to fetch...");
  gprs.send(http_cmd, sizeof(http_cmd)-1);
  while (true) {
      int ret = gprs.recv(buffer, sizeof(buffer)-1);
      if (ret <= 0){
          Serial.println("fetch over...");
          break;
      }
      buffer[ret] = '\0';
      Serial.print("Recv: ");
      Serial.print(ret);
      Serial.print(" bytes: ");
      Serial.println(buffer);
  }
  gprs.close();
  gprs.disconnect();
}

void loop(){

}

void SIM800_PreInit(void)
{
    Serial.println("SIM800 PreInit...");
    pinMode(SIM800_POWER_STATUS,INPUT);
    delay(10);
    if(LOW == digitalRead(SIM800_POWER_STATUS))
    {
        if(sim900_send_AT() != true)
        {            
            delay(800);
            digitalWrite(SIM800_POWER_PIN,HIGH);
            delay(200);
            digitalWrite(SIM800_POWER_PIN,LOW);
            delay(2000);
            digitalWrite(SIM800_POWER_PIN,HIGH);
            delay(3000);  
        }
        while(sim900_send_AT() != true);                
        Serial.println("Init O.K!");         
    }
    else
    {
        Serial.println("Power check failed!");  
    }
}
```
